## Risk-identifying heart disease patients using Clustering

Welcome to the directory for the Identifying Risk in Patients with Heart Disease using Clustering project! In this project, we explore how the K-Means algorithm can be applied to cluster patients and identify groups at higher risk of developing heart disease.

## Description

In this project, we employ the K-Means algorithm as an effective tool for analyzing medical data and grouping patients into different profiles. By identifying patterns in the data, our goal is to recognize groups of patients with similar characteristics that may be associated with a higher risk of developing heart disease.

## Content

- Exploration of patient data
- Application of the K-Means algorithm
- Identification of risk groups
- Visualization of results

## Results

The results of this project provide valuable insights for healthcare professionals and researchers, enabling a more personalized approach to the treatment and follow-up of patients at risk of heart disease.

## How to Use
