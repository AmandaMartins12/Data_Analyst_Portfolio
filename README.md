# Data_Analyst_Portfolio
Welcome to my Data Analyst Projects Portfolio!

Here I present a selection of projects using analytical skills and tools such as Python, Power BI and Statistics, in addition to Machine Learning Models to extract important insights from the data.

You will find data visualizations, graphs and relevant statistics to illustrate the findings and impacts achieved in each project. 
My goal is to show how the analyses performed contributed to informed decision making and drove project success. 

I invite you to explore my Portfolio to learn about my skills and achievements in this area.
